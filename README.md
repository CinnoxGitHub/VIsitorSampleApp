# **Android Quick Start Guide**
This guide will help you know how to use the CINNOX Visitor SDK on Android application through the sample app demonstration.
 
## **Step 1: Add Libraries and Dependencies**
1. Add the following code snippet inside the repositories block to the app/build.gradle section:
   
```kotlin
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
This will include the JitPack repository in your project, allowing you to fetch dependencies from it.

2. Add the following code snippet inside the dependencies block:

```kotlin
implementation 'com.github.CinnoxGitHub:visitor_sdk:1.0.3'
```
This line specifies the dependency on the visitor_sdk library from the JitPack repository. 

Sync your project with the Gradle files by clicking on the "Sync Now" button or selecting File > Sync Project with Gradle Files.
Congratulations! You have successfully updated the dependencies using JitPack. The visitor_sdk library is now included in your Android project.

## **Step 2: Set Up and Initialisation**
1. Open the MainActivity.kt file.

2. Replace the value of serviceId with your CINNOX subdomain. (Login to your CINNOX Dashboard. Navigate to Administration> Widget> Installation. The URL on the right hand side of the Domain row is the subdomain.)
```kotlin
const val serviceId = "xxxx.cinnox.com"
```
3. Init CinnoxVisitorCore  
```kotlin
val core = CinnoxVisitorCore.initialize(this, serviceId)
```

4. Add CinnoxVisitorCoreListener and register it when you need to know the initialisation end.
```kotlin
 private val mCoreListener: CinnoxVisitorCoreListener = object : CinnoxVisitorCoreListener{
        override fun onInitializationEnd(success: Boolean, throwable: Throwable?) {
            Log.d(TAG, "onInitializationEnd, isSuccess: $success, throwable: $throwable")
        }
    }
 core.registerListener(mCoreListener)
```

## **Step 3: Show your CINNOX Widget to Users**
Add CinnoxVisitorWidget in the layout activity_main.xml

```kotlin
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context=".MainActivity">

    <com.m800.maaiiconnect.mobile.client.CinnoxVisitorWidget
        android:id="@+id/floating_button"
        android:layout_width="72dp"
        android:layout_height="72dp"
        android:gravity="center"
        android:scaleType="fitCenter"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent" />

</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```

## **Step 4: Support Firebase Clould Message**
To integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) of your application with our library, you have to provide us with the following info:

`Package Name`:
The package name is a unique identifier for your Android application. It is typically defined in the AndroidManifest.xml file of your project. To find the package name:

1. Open your Android project in Android Studio.
2. In the Project view, navigate to the "app" folder.
3. Expand the "app" folder and locate the "AndroidManifest.xml" file.
4. Open the "AndroidManifest.xml" file and find the "package" attribute in the "manifest" tag.
5. The value of the "package" attribute is your package name. It usually follows a pattern like "com.example.myapp".

`FCM Server Key`:
The FCM Server key is a unique identifier used to authenticate requests from the server to the FCM API. To generate the FCM Server Key:

1. Go to the Firebase console (console.firebase.google.com).
2. Select your Firebase project or create a new one.
3. Navigate to the "Project settings" by clicking on the gear icon.
4. In the "Project settings" page, select the "Cloud Messaging" tab.
5. Scroll down to the "Server Key" section.
6. If you haven't generated a server key before, click on the "Create Server Key" button. If you have an existing server key, you can use it.
7. A dialog box will appear displaying your FCM Service Key. Copy the key and provide it to our library.

Please send us your info via email at support@cinnox.com with "Info for FCM" as the email subject.

interface CinnoxVisitorCoreListener

/**
